Do you find that documents generated by ordinary large language models contain only text without images, making them dry and uninteresting? Try ColorDoc, the world's only fully autonomous agent that supports automatic insertion of 5 types of image formats into documents, creating richly illustrated content that makes documents colourful and insightful.

ColorDoc is a revolutionary rich image document writing agent that not only serves as a fully autonomous agent capable of completing complex document writing, data analysis, programming, web search and other tasks through built-in tools, but also has been extensively optimized for document writing and supports MCP for tool extension.

Its features include:

1.  Supports generation of rich illustrated reports with diverse images (Mermaid diagrams, SVG diagrams, Google/Baidu image search, AI-generated images, code-generated images), where large models can directly output mixed text and image layout formats;

2.  Supports long document generation, capable of producing complete reports, applications, papers, patents, etc., reaching 30-50 pages in length;

3.  Elegant writing style similar to academic papers and in-depth reports, unlike ordinary large models that only list points without writing details, ColorDoc's writing is more professional and human-like, suitable for in-depth writing applications;
