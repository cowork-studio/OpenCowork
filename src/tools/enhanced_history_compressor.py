Enhanced History Compressor - Direct record deletion compression:
1. When history exceeds trigger_length, compress to target_length (preserve last N rounds)
2. Insert deletion note at the position where records were deleted
3. Using target_length (usually smaller than trigger_length) prevents repeated compression cycles
